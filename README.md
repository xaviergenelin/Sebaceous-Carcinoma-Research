# Sebaceous-Carcinoma-Research

This repository will have our work for the research around sebaceous carcinoma. The current outline given is the following:

1. Ambient UV exposure and sebaceous carcinoma incidence. Looking at this association as a cohort.

Sub Analyses:

1. UV Exposure and SC (stratified based on sex)
2. Looking at UV Exposure and SC in non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Asian Americans/Alaskans?

The associations can be displayed as scatterplots

The methodology of the JAMA derm papers seems robust - can we model the exact same methodology? They only did univariate analyses for latitude and UV exposure
